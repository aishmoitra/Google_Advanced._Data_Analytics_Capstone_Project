     - `overworked`: Hours worked beyond normal limits.
   - Additional factors such as `salary_low` and `work_accident` also influence attrition.
2. **Modeling Insights**:
   - Logistic regression provided clear interpretability.
   - Random forest yielded higher predictive accuracy and feature importance insights.
   - Both models identified overworking and low salaries as primary contributors to turnover.
